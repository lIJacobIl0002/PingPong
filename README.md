# PingPong
A Ping Pong game that has been made using LUA and Love2D. It contains 3 main files (main.lua, ball.lua, and square.lua)

main.lua contains mostly everything like opening/rendering Objects to the Window, Moving players, etc.

ball.lua contains the ball class

square.lua contains the player class

This may be buggy as it has not been worked on for more than a day.
